    Overview:

        Shader program 'instancing':
            Get shader desc: instancing_shader_desc()
            Vertex shader: vs_i
                Attribute slots:
                    ATTR_vs_i_pos = 0
                    ATTR_vs_i_color0 = 1
                    ATTR_vs_i_texcoord0 = 2
                    ATTR_vs_i_inst_pos = 3
                Uniform block 'vs_params_i':
                    C struct: vs_params_i_t
                    Bind slot: SLOT_vs_params_i = 0
            Fragment shader: fs_i
                Image 'tex':
                    Type: SG_IMAGETYPE_2D
                    Component Type: SG_SAMPLERTYPE_FLOAT
                    Bind slot: SLOT_tex = 0


    Shader descriptor structs:

        sg_shader instancing = sg_make_shader(instancing_shader_desc());

    Vertex attribute locations for vertex shader 'vs_i':

        sg_pipeline pip = sg_make_pipeline(&(sg_pipeline_desc){
            .layout = {
                .attrs = {
                    [ATTR_vs_i_pos] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_i_color0] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_i_texcoord0] = { ... },
                    [ATTR_vs_i_inst_pos] = { ... },
                },
            },
            ...});

    Image bind slots, use as index in sg_bindings.vs_images[] or .fs_images[]

        SLOT_tex = 0;

    Bind slot and C-struct for uniform block 'vs_params_i':

        vs_params_i_t vs_params_i = {
            .mvp = ...;
        };
        sg_apply_uniforms(SG_SHADERSTAGE_[VS|FS], SLOT_vs_params_i, &vs_params_i, sizeof(vs_params_i));
