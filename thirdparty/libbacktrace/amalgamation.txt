The libbacktrace source is distributed here as an amalgamation (https://sqlite.org/amalgamation.html).
This means that, rather than mirroring the entire libbacktrace repo here,
a script was used to bundle all local includes together into a single C file,
with additional platform specific files which is much easier to handle.
