**Problem that you are trying to solve:**

**What you did:**

======Please delete the message past this point after reading it======

Please title your PR as follows: `time: fix foo bar`.
Always start with the thing you are fixing, then describe the fix.
Use a verb's base form and never use past tense (Use "fix foo bar" instead of "fixed foo bar").

Fill in the questions above the line.
Refer to the GitHub issue if you were fixing an issue that is already reported. (Use the issue's ID like so: #1234)
The what you did part should contain what you did from a higher-level stand point.
Instead of mentioning that you used a linked list and flattened them, it's much more useful to say that you are using some algorithm.
If it's a complex and uncommon, a link to the algorithm's Wikipedia page would be much appreciated to help understand the aim of your code.

If you are adding a new function, please add documentation comments and add tests similar to the example below:
```
// foo creates bar, interacts with foo and returns bar.
fn foo(a, b int) {

// inside file_test.v
fn test_foo() {
	// Try to add as much edge cases as you can think of.
	// This makes sure no one breaks your implementation in the future.
	assert foo(0, 0) == ...
	assert foo(0, 100) == ...
	...
}
```

If you are fixing a bug, please add a test that covers it.

Before submitting a PR, please run the builds and tests with `make all`, and make sure V can still compile itself by building it twice.
Specifically run the following in the V's repository root:
```
$ ./v -o v compiler
$ ./v -o v compiler
```

PRs are reviewed as soon as possible and should be handled within 24 hours unless there's a high load of them.

Please don't add labels to PR. It's unnecessary for now.

Thanks a lot for your contribution towards V!
