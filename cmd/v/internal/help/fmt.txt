Usage: 
  v [flags] fmt path_to_source.v [path_to_other_source.v]

Formats the given V source files, then prints their formatted source to stdout.

Options:
  -c    check if file is already formatted.
        If it is not, print filepath, and exit with code 2.
  -diff display only diffs between the formatted source and the original source.
  -l    list files whose formatting differs from vfmt.
  -w    write result to (source) file(s) instead of to stdout.
  -2    Use the new V parser/vfmt. NB: this is EXPERIMENTAL for now.
          The new vfmt is much faster and more forgiving.
          It also may EAT some of your code for now.
          Please be careful, and make frequent BACKUPS, when running with -vfmt2 .
