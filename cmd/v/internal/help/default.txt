V is a tool for managing V source code.

Usage:
   v [options] [command] [arguments]

Examples:
   v hello.v         compile the file `hello.v` and output it as `hello` or `hello.exe`
   v run hello.v     same as above but also run the produced executable immediately after compilation

The commands are:
   build             build V code in the provided path (default)
   create            setup the file structure for a V project
   doc               generates the documentation for a V module (coming soon in 0.3)
   fmt               format the V code provided
   repl              run the REPL
   run               compile and run a V program
   symlink           create a symbolic link for V
   translate         translate C code to V (coming soon in 0.3)
   up                run the V self-updater
   self              run the V self-compiler
   version           prints the version text and exits

   build-examples    test if all examples can be built
   build-tools       test if all tools can be built
