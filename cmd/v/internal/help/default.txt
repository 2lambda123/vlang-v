V is a tool for managing V source code.

Usage:
   v [options] [command] [arguments]

Examples:
   v hello.v         compile the file `hello.v` and output it as `hello` or `hello.exe`
   v run hello.v     same as above but also run the produced executable immediately after compilation
   v -o h.c hello.v  translate `hello.v` to `h.c` . Do not compile further.

The commands are:
   build             build V code in the provided path (default)
   create            setup the file structure for a V project in a new directory
   init              setup the file structure for a V project in the current directory
   doc               generates the documentation for a V module (coming soon in 0.3)
   fmt               format the V code provided
   repl              run the REPL
   run               compile and run a V program
   symlink           create a symbolic link for V
   test              run all test files in the provided directory
   translate         translate C code to V (coming soon in 0.3)
   up                run the V self-updater
   self              run the V self-compiler
   version           prints the version text and exits

   install           installs a module from VPM
   remove            removes a module that was installed from VPM
   search            searches for a module from VPM
   update            updates an installed module from VPM

Use "v help <command>" for more information about a command, example: `v help build`
Use "v help other" to see less frequently used commands.

Note: Help is required to write more help topics. 
Only build, fmt, run, test, search, install, remove, update, bin2v are properly documented currently.
