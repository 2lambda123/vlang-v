Usage: v [build flags] run <file.v|directory> [arguments...]

Run compiles and runs the named target.

This command is equivalent to running `v build` and running the compiled executable.
The executable is executed with the command: `a.out arguments...`.

The exit status of Run will be:
* `1` if the compilation failed.
* The exit code of the compiled executable otherwise.

For more about build flags, see `v help build`.
