These are utility commands that you can also launch through v,
but which are used less frequently by users:
   
   bin2v             convert a binary file to a v source file, 
                     that can be later embedded in a module or program
   
   build-examples    test if all examples can be built
   build-tools       test if all tools can be built
   build-vbinaries   test if V can be built with different configuration
   test-fmt          test if all files in the current directory is formatted properly
   test-compiler     test if V is working properly by running all tests, including the compiler ones 
                     NB: this can take a minute or two to run

   setup-freetype    setup thirdparty freetype on Windows
