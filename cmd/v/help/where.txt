Usage:
  v where [symbol_type] [symbol_name] [params]

Examples:
  v where fn main
  v where struct User
  v where fn say_hello -mod Person
  v where fn area -m-of Square
  v where interface callable -dir some -dir other

  enum
  fn                    (by default if omit [symbol_type])
  interface
  struct
  var

params:
  -mod  [mod_name]      Restrict to search only within of the given module,
                        if not provided, search in entire project.
  -dir  [dirs_name]     Restrict to search within the given folder/s,
                        if not provided, search in entire project scope.
  -vis  [visibility]    Can be: all, pub, pri (all by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given visibility.
  -mut  [mutability]    Can be: any, yes, not (any by default if not provided).
                        Restrict to search symbols with the given mutability.

Note: 
  This tool is heavily inspired by the vdoc tool and its design. 
  However, this is for a more specific use, and consequently less sophisticated.
